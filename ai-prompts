A Vue 3 component that shows advice from https://api.adviceslip.com/advice on screen.
Next create a search box and show the search results from https://api.adviceslip.com/advice

The returned (example) search object from https://api.adviceslip.com/advice has the following format:
{
"total_results": "2",
"slips": [
{
"advice": "Remember that spiders are more afraid of you, than you are of them."
},
{
"advice":"Smile and the world smiles with you. Frown and you're on your own."
}
]
}

total_results integer Total number of matching advice slips found.
query integer The search query provided.
slips string An array of slip objects matching the search query.

If there are no results for the search query, show a message on screen that says: No results


It worked! But i changed my request a bit:
Create a search box where user can type a keyword and search for movies in
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=10a8315&t='searchterm'
If there are no result, display a message.
Clear the movie results array whenever the search term changes.
Make the button responsive again for the next search.
You can find the API endpoint specifications on this webpage: https://www.omdbapi.com/
Shows the results including the "Internet Movie Database" rating.
